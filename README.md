# GithubFinder
NOTE: This app uses GitHub API

A simple React App for searching user of Github and see their profile.

## What do you need
- NodeJS installed on your machine
- Visual Studio Code or any other IDE or Editor

## How To Use
- Open the project with your favorite IDE or Editor
- If it has an integrated terminal, open it (otherwise open a cmd/bash) and paste the following command:
  
  > npm install
  
  This command will download all the "node_modules" folder which contains all the dependency necessary for the server.

- Once the download has been completed, make a copy of the file ".env.default" and rename it as ".env"
- Open that file and insert into it the ACCESS_TOKEN generated from github settings (https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- Return to the terminal and paste the following command in order to start the server:
  
  > npm run start
  
  This command will start the server and will take it on until you close it.
